				<p>Six pack rings float and are light enough to be easily moved by the wind.</p>
				<p style="visibility:hidden;" id="three1">Many animals mistake the floating objects as food and eat them.</p>
				<p style="visibility:hidden;" id="three2">Some young animals get trapped and as they grow the rings cut into their flesh.</p>
				<p style="visibility:hidden;" id="three3">Thousands of birds, turtles, marine mammals, and other wildlife are killed every year by discarded six pack rings.</p>
				<p style="visibility:hidden;" id="three4">Throw away your trash appropriately so that animals don't have to suffer.</p>
